Car Keypoint Detection using Detectron2 🚗🔍
This project focuses on detecting keypoints on cars (e.g., wheels, mirrors) using Detectron2 (Keypoint R-CNN). The model is trained on a custom dataset and predicts keypoints with high precision.

📌 Features
🚀 Detects keypoints on car images (e.g., wheels, mirrors)
🔍 Uses Detectron2 for keypoint detection
📊 Supports training & inference
🖥 Gradio Web Interface for real-time keypoint detection
